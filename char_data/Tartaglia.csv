DMG dealt in this way is considered Normal Attack DMG. • Riptide Flash: A fully-charged Aimed Shot that hits an opponent affected by Riptide deals consecutive bouts of AoE DMG. Can occur once every 0.7s. • Riptide Burst: Defeating an opponent affected by Riptide creates a Hydro burst that inflicts the Riptide status on nearby opponents hit. ,Attack 1-Hit DMG,41.28%,44.64%,48%,52.8%,56.16%,60%,65.28%,70.56%,75.84%,81.6%,87.36%,93.12%,98.88%,104.64%,110.4%,Attack 2-Hit DMG,46.27%,50.03%,53.8%,59.18%,62.95%,67.25%,73.17%,79.09%,85%,91.46%,97.92%,104.37%,110.83%,117.28%,123.74%,Attack 3-Hit DMG,55.38%,59.89%,64.4%,70.84%,75.35%,80.5%,87.58%,94.67%,101.75%,109.48%,117.21%,124.94%,132.66%,140.39%,148.12%,Attack 4-Hit DMG,57.02%,61.66%,66.3%,72.93%,77.57%,82.88%,90.17%,97.46%,104.75%,112.71%,120.67%,128.62%,136.58%,144.53%,152.49%,Attack 5-Hit DMG,60.89%,65.84%,70.8%,77.88%,82.84%,88.5%,96.29%,104.08%,111.86%,120.36%,128.86%,137.35%,145.85%,154.34%,162.84%,Attack 6-Hit DMG,72.76%,78.68%,84.6%,93.06%,98.98%,105.75%,115.06%,124.36%,133.67%,143.82%,153.97%,164.12%,174.28%,184.43%,194.58%,Attack Aimed Shot,43.86%,47.43%,51%,56.1%,59.67%,63.75%,69.36%,74.97%,80.58%,86.7%,92.82%,98.94%,105.06%,111.18%,117.3%,Attack Fully-Charged Aimed Shot,124%,133.3%,142.6%,155%,164.3%,173.6%,186%,198.4%,210.8%,223.2%,235.6%,248%,263.5%,279%,294.5%,Attack Riptide Flash DMG,12.4%×3,13.33%×3,14.26%×3,15.5%×3,16.43%×3,17.36%×3,18.6%×3,19.84%×3,21.08%×3,22.32%×3,23.56%×3,24.8%×3,26.35%×3,27.9%×3,29.45%×3,Attack Riptide Burst DMG,62%,66.65%,71.3%,77.5%,82.15%,86.8%,93%,99.2%,105.4%,111.6%,117.8%,124%,131.75%,139.5%,147.25%,Attack Riptide Duration,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,10s,Attack Plunge DMG,63.93%,69.14%,74.34%,81.77%,86.98%,92.93%,101.1%,109.28%,117.46%,126.38%,135.3%,144.22%,153.14%,162.06%,170.98%,Attack Low/High Plunge DMG,127.84% / 159.68%,138.24% / 172.67%,148.65% / 185.67%,163.51% / 204.24%,173.92% / 217.23%,185.81% / 232.09%,202.16% / 252.51%,218.51% / 272.93%,234.86% / 293.36%,252.7% / 315.64%,270.54% / 337.92%,288.38% / 360.2%,306.22% / 382.48%,324.05% / 404.76%,341.89% / 427.04%,Foul Legacy: Raging Tide,"Normal Attack: Unleashes a set of weaponry made of pure water, dealing Hydro DMG to surrounding opponents and entering Melee Stance.
