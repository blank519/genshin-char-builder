# Genshin Character Builder
### Description:  
A Discord bot to assist people in building characters in Genshin Impact based on what they currently have, by allowing users to see the stats and damage of different combinations of characters and equipment without the tedious process required to do the same thing in-game.  

Upon being run, the bot first updates all data by web scraping Honey Hunter to add new character and item data. Then, it waits for command messages from users in the server, then acts accordingly.  



### Commands:  
```$new```: Create and select a new character, weapon, or artifact, according to given specifications. Not case sensitive.  
```$equip```: Equip the selected character with the selected weapon, artifact, or artifacts. If something was already equipped, gives the option to select it or keep selection on the newly equipped weapon.  
```$unequip```: Unequip the selected character's weapon, artifact, or artifacts. Gives the option to select it.  
```$display```: Give a summary of the selected character, weapon, or artifact, including stats provided.  
```$stats```: Show the total stats of the selected character with his/her equipped weapon and artifacts.  
```$dmg```: Shows a number representing a character's average damage output, NOT equal to how much damage the character will output.
**Note: Aside from standard levels of characters (1, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90), data on base stats (HP, ATK, DEF) and reaction damage is estimated and may be slightly inaccurate.**
